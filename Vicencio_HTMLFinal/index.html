        Going to school can be scary sometimes. You don’t know who you’ll meet, if you’ll like the work you make, or if you’ll learn what you need to. Thankfully, I wanted to come to school everyday. I’ve always wanted to learn how to build collages in Photoshop, work with vectors in Illustrator, build layouts in InDesign. I don’t have any art school experience, I didn’t take a design fundamentals course, I tried to apply the techniques that my favorite artists use when it came to my assignments. Hopefully, it resonates somewhere.
