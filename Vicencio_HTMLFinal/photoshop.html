Before starting the Raster assignment, I knew I would be working with the same picture for over an hour, so I wanted to pick a subject that I would feel comfortable looking at. There’s a picture I took of my mom coming to visit sometime in May, and its playfulness made it really easy to work with - it provided many options to work with. I always try to play with putting opposites together to make a more complete composition. The text of “wishing you were here” gives the composition a post card feel to it (I wish I could say I foresaw the postcard assignment, but I can’t) when I tried for something similar to an instagram story.

        In the end, I wanted to take my mom somewhere she's never been before.
