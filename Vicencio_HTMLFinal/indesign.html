          Making print layouts always interests me with its freedom to place pictures and text into a readable, whole composition. I find these prints similar to a painting, in which it offers the audience something to experience, while trying to convey a message. With my project, I offered an update into the things I learned in this class, whilst trying to challenge traditional layout practices. These are principles and ideas that I find interesting, and I wouldnâ€™t be able to accomplish without this class - it was an opportunity to meet in the middle.
