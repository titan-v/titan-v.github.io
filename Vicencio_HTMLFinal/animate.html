            This was not what I had in mind, but what I was able to accomplish. While it is the same picture as my Vector assignment, which I am proud of, I am not happy with my finished product for the Animation assignment. However, I am thankful for the experience working with Animate and it reminded me of my experience editing videos. I enjoyed creating the timing of the character walking in, looking around and feeling sick, and eventually throwing up on Kermit. Iâ€™m not sure if I will continue to work with Animation, but at least I can say I did it.
