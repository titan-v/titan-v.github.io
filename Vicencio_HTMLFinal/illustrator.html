            Illustrator was the application I was most excited to work with. The idea of drawing something that’s editable and has an extensive color palette attracts me to this program. Whenever I draw in my notebook, I find myself wanting to change a detail or a line or wondering what the figure would look like in different colors, and Illustrator fulfills this. I don’t have much experience with color theory, so that’s something I will work on next time, but I like the drawing and I want to do more work like this.
